# 🔥 Safe Path Finder in Smoke-Filled Environments

**safe_path_lib** is a Python-based AI library designed to detect and visualize the safest path in real-time from a smoke-filled or low-visibility environment using a video or camera feed.

Built using `OpenCV`, `NetworkX`, and `NumPy`, it simulates evacuation guidance by identifying obstacle-free zones and generating a clear escape path with depth-aware visual overlays.
